## Setup and Deployment

### 1. Bootstrap Configuration

Before deploying, you must create a `.env` file and set the essential variables required for the bot to start up.

1.  **Clone the Repository** on your local machine or server.
2.  **Create and Configure the `.env` File:** In the `sports_bot` directory, create a file named `.env` and add the following bootstrap variables:

    ```
    # .env file - BOOTSTRAP VARIABLES

    SUPABASE_DB_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
    ADMIN_CHAT_ID="YOUR_PERSONAL_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
    SETUP_PASSWORD="CREATE_A_SECURE_PASSWORD"
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    PA_USERNAME="your-pythonanywhere-username-or-domain.com"
    ```

### 2. Secure On-Demand Configuration

After the first deployment, you must configure the bot's API keys securely via Telegram.

1.  **Start the Bot:** Follow the deployment instructions for either PythonAnywhere or VPS below.
2.  **Send the `/setup` command** to the bot from your admin account.
3.  **Provide the password and API keys** when prompted. After providing each key, press the **"ðŸ§ª Test Key"** button to validate it in real time.
4.  **Perform the Final Restart (Required):**
    -   Once all keys are provided and tested, you must perform a one-time, manual restart of the application for the new settings to be loaded into memory.
    -   On a VPS, run: `docker-compose restart`
    -   On PythonAnywhere, click the **"Reload"** button on the "Web" tab.
    -   *Why is this necessary?* A running application cannot restart itself. The restart command must be given by the hosting environment (Docker or PythonAnywhere) to ensure the application loads the new configuration cleanly and correctly. This is a standard practice for all production web applications.

## Deployment Guides

Choose one of the following deployment methods.

### Option A: Deployment on a VPS with Docker (Recommended)

This method is flexible, scalable, and recommended for a production environment.

1.  **Prerequisites:** A VPS with Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, and a domain name.
2.  **Deploy:** Copy your `.env` file to the server and run `docker-compose up --build -d`.
3.  **Configure Nginx:** Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy and enable HTTPS with Certbot.
4.  **Set Webhook:** Point Telegram to your secure webhook URL: `https://your.domain.com/webhook`.
5.  **Set Cron Job:** Create a cron job on the VPS to run the worker script inside the container:
    ```
    */5 * * * * docker exec strategic-oracle-bot python run_analysis_worker.py
    ```

### Option B: Deployment on PythonAnywhere Free Tier

This method is excellent for getting started quickly without needing your own server.

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    -   In a PythonAnywhere Bash console, clone the repository.
    -   Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/sportsbot-venv`.
    -   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    -   Upload your `.env` file to the `sports_bot` directory via the "Files" tab.

2.  **Create a New Web App:**
    -   Go to the **Web** tab and **Add a new web app**.
    -   Choose **Manual configuration** and the same Python version as your virtual environment.

3.  **Configure the Web App:**
    -   **Virtualenv:** Set the path to `/home/<your-username>/.virtualenvs/sportsbot-venv`.
    -   **WSGI File:** Edit the file to point to your Flask app:
        ```python
        import sys
        path = '/home/<your-username>/sports_bot'
        if path not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, path)
        from app import app as application
        ```
    -   **Reload** the web app.

4.  **Set the Telegram Webhook:**
    -   Run the `curl` command to set your webhook, using your PythonAnywhere URL:
        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://<user>.pythonanywhere.com/webhook"
        ```

5.  **Run the `/setup` Command** as described in the "Secure On-Demand Configuration" section above, then **Reload your web app** again.

6.  **Create the Scheduled Task for the Worker:**
    -   Go to the **Tasks** tab.
    -   Create a new **Scheduled task**.
    -   Set the command to run the worker script with your virtualenv:
        ```bash
        /home/<your-username>/.virtualenvs/sportsbot-venv/bin/python /home/<your-username>/sports_bot/run_analysis_worker.py
        ```
    -   Schedule the task to run every **5-10 minutes**.

The Strategic Oracle is now fully deployed and operational.
